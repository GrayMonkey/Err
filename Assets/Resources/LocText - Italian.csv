UI_TileRefDetailsAccum,"[IT] When the active player STARTS their turn on this tile they take their turn as normal. If they get the answer correct they can choose to either keep their score and move or answer an additional question. However, for additional questions the active player nominates the level of difficulty of the clue. If they get the answer correct to the additional question the clue amount is added to the move score they already have. A maximum of four additional questions can be asked. If at any time during the additional questions the player gets the answer wrong then they can no longer take additional questions and move a total of their accumulated score."
UI_TileRefDetailsBlank,[IT] The blank tile has no special affect and is counted as one move.
UI_TileRefDetailsController,"[IT] When the active player STARTS their turn on this tile not only do they move normally but they can also move other players to a total equal to their move, i.e. if they scored a move of three then they can move another player three spaces, two players one and two spaces respectively, or three players a single space each."
UI_TileRefDetailsDoubler,[IT] When the active player STARTS their turn on this tile whatever they score is doubled and the player moves that amount of spaces.
UI_TileRefDetailsOneShot,[IT] When the active player ENDS their turn on this tile they can take an extra turn but only with one clue given. If they get the answer right they continue to move the according number of spaces for that clue only.
UI_TileRefDetailsOpen,[IT] When the active player STARTS on this tile they essentially lose their turn and asks their opposing players the question as normal. If an opposing player guesses correctly they move the relevant number of spaces. The active player is the judge in any answers called out simultaneously! The active player is only penalised once and continues their game as normal on their next turn.
UI_TileRefDetailsSplitter,"[IT] When the active player STARTS their turn on this tile they take their turn as normal. If they get the answer correct they can choose to either keep their score and move or answer an additional question. However, for additional questions the active player nominates the level of difficulty of the clue. If they get the answer correct to the additional question the clue amount is added to the move score they already have. A maximum of four additional questions can be asked. If at any time during the additional questions the player gets the answer wrong then they can no longer take additional questions and move a total of their accumulated score."
